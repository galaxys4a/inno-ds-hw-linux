When we call a fork function, a new (a child respect to the current that is called parent) process is created.
It inherits independent copies of all file descriptors. So both of the processes have access to the files.
Closing the file descriptor in one process will not close it in the other.
And which process is working with file at the moment? The kernel schedules all processes, so we can not say exactly which of two.
